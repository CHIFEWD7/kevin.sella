Some people can’t handle success, I can. The key to success is to keep your head above the water, never give up. Another one. The key to more success is to have a lot of pillows. It’s important to use cocoa butter. It’s the key to more success, why not live smooth? Why live rough? I’m up to something. I’m giving you cloth talk, cloth. Special cloth alert, cut from a special cloth. How’s business? Boomin. You smart, you loyal, you a genius. You smart, you loyal, you a genius. They don’t want us to eat. Learning is cool, but knowing is better, and I know the key to success. Cloth talk. Surround yourself with angels. How’s business? Boomin. The key is to enjoy life, because they don’t want you to enjoy life. I promise you, they don’t want you to jetski, they don’t want you to smile. Celebrate success right, the only way, apple. To be successful you’ve got to work hard, to make history, simple, you’ve got to make it.</p>

In life there will be road blocks but we will over come it. Celebrate success right, the only way, apple. We don’t see them, we will never see them. I told you all this before, when you have a swimming pool, do not use chlorine, use salt water, the healing, salt water is the healing. The key to success is to keep your head above the water, never give up. They never said winning was easy. Some people can’t handle success, I can. Don’t ever play yourself. Always remember in the jungle there’s a lot of they in there, after you overcome they, you will make it to paradise. The other day the grass was brown, now it’s green because I ain’t give up. Never surrender. Major key, don’t fall for the trap, stay focused. It’s the ones closest to you that want to see you fail. Let me be clear, you have to make it through the jungle to make it to paradise, that’s the key, Lion!</p>
