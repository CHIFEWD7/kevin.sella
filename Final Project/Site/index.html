            <p>Oh, yeah, the guy in the the $4,000 suit is holding the elevator for a guy who doesn't make that in three months. Come on! It's as Ann as the nose on plain's face. Waiting for the Emmys. BTW did you know won 6 Emmys and was still canceled early by Fox? COME ON. Gosh Mom… after all these years, God's not going to take a call from you. It's sort of like going from prime rib to… I don't know… weird brother of prime rib. No, Pop-pop does not get a treat, I just brought you a [bleep]ing pizza. Yo quiero leche. Yo quiero leche de madre. Douche chill! We need a name. Maybe "Operation Hot Mother." No, let's try to top that. (They never did.) What have we always said is the most important thing?</p>

            <p>My brother wasn't optimistic it could be done, but I didn't take "wasn't optimistic it could be done" for an answer. She's a contestant. It's sorta like an inner beauty pageant. Ah, there it is. I know she's a brownish area! With points! And I love her! Bob Loblaw Lobs Law Bomb. George Michael, you want to put your head down there by his drainage shunt? She keeps saying that God is going to show me a sign. The… something of my ways. Of course. The "Bob Loblaw Law Blog." Wow. You, sir, are a mouthful! Hey, if I can't find a horny immigrant by then, I don't deserve to stay. You're a good guy, mon frere. 
            That means brother in French. I don't know how I know that. I took four years of Spanish. Oh please. They didn't sneak into this country to be your friends. I'M A MONSTER!! Ah coodle doodle doo, ah coodle doodle doo. In fact, it was a box of Oscar's legally obtained medical marijuana. Primo bud. Real sticky weed. Please refrain from discussing or engaging in any sort of interoffice [bleep] or [bleep] or finger[bleep] or [bleep]sting or [bleep] or even [bleep]. She's always got to wedge herself in the middle of us so that she can control everything. Yeah. Mom's awesome. Well, I spent so much time making sweet love on my wife that it's hard to hear anything over the clatter of her breasts. I am getting rid of this thing. It has caused me nothing but pride and self-respect.</p>
